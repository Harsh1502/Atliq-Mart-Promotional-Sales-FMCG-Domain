Mysuru is witnessing the highest incremental revenue among the analyzed locations.
The Diwali campaign is proving to be more effective than the Sankranti campaign.
Diwali Total Revenue : 290 Million
Sankranti Total Revenue : 199 Million


🚀 Promotion Type Analysis:

The 500 cashback and Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF) promotion types gathered 123 Million & 69 Million Incremental Revenue respectively.
The 25% off promotion is performing poorly and facing significant challenges.

📈 Performance by City:

Highest Outlet stores are in Bengaluru City tallying around 150 stores
Increased focus needed for marketing and operational strategies in Vijayawada and Trivandrum as they have lowest number of outlets

🛍 Product Category Analysis:

Atliq Farm Chakki Atta & Atliq Sunflower Oil have seen a significant amount of Sales garnering around 80k in quantity sold.
Personal Care Category needs more catering as it the lowest performing category.
Introducing cashback and BOGOF offers might boost the sales.

💡 Suggestions for Improvement:

Focus on marketing and operational strategies.
Expand store presence and provide additional promotional offers.
2. Personal Care Items:
Implement BOGOF offers to boost sales.
Redirect focus towards promoting more personal care items in specific stores.
